# Task 1 - Create Your First Mobile App

- Created folder: `prodev-mobile-app-0x00`
- Ran: `npx create-expo-app@latest .` using Expo Router template
- Edited `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`: changed "Welcome!" to "** First App Created**"
- Will run the app later using `npx expo start` and test it with Expo Go
- Ran `npm run reset-project`: expected to clean `.expo` and `node_modules`, full effect to be confirmed after testing
